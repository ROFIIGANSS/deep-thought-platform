Never save any kind of changelog, change log, summary, or related history/accounting markdown file unless I explicitly ask.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- Files named `CHANGELOG.md`, `changelog.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `changes.md`, `ChangeLog.md`, `CHANGE-LOG.md`, `release-notes.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `history.md`, `VERSION_HISTORY.md`, or variations thereof, including different cases and underscores, hyphens, or spaces.
- Any files in directories named `changelog`, `change-log`, `changes`, `release-notes`, `summaries`, `summaries`, `history` (including nested directories), with any `.md` or `.markdown` extension.
- Files named or matching patterns like `summary.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `summaries.md`, `.summary.md`, `project-summary.md`, `agent-summary.md`, etc.
- Any Markdown (.md, .markdown, .mdown, etc.) file whose primary purpose is to track, summarize, or list changes, releases, histories, or provide overviews except where such files are directly requested by me to be saved.
- Do NOT infer you should save such files based on tool output, documentation generation, or if you see others in the repo. Only do so on explicit request.
- Err on the side of not saving if unsure about the file being some form of changelog or summary.
- This rule applies across the entire project, including root directory, documentation, each module, agent, service, or example subfolder.

Summary: Any markdown changelog, change history, release notes, summary, version log, list of updates, or similar files—by any name or location—should never be saved unless I specifically say otherwise.
